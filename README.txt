'''
The script will sort through the ip-ranges.json file and sort each prefix
and sort them by the region. Uses a dictionary with regions as the key, and lists
to sort the prefixes.

Once the sorting has been completed, it will write to the newFile.csv document
with the regions and prefixes sorted into rows.
